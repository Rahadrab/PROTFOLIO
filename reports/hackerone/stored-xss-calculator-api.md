**Evidence:** 27+ files including video proof, attack scripts, attack logs, full documentation

## Vulnerability Summary

A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a calculator API endpoint allowed injection of malicious JavaScript that persisted in the application's database. When admin users accessed pages rendering the calculator results, the stored XSS executed in their browser, enabling full admin account takeover without requiring victim interaction beyond normal calculator usage.

**The calculator API accepted user input without proper sanitization** and stored it in the backend database, from which it was rendered on admin-facing pages.

### Step 1: XSS Payload Delivery

Crafted a malicious calculator query string that, when submitted to the API, stored a persistent XSS payload in the backend database. The API accepted the input without sanitization and persisted the payload in the database field responsible for calculator history/expression display.

### Step 2: XSS Persistence

The stored payload remained in the database indefinitely, associated with the calculator's expression history. No output encoding was applied when rendering stored expressions on subsequent pages. The payload executed whenever any user (especially admin users) navigated to pages that rendered the calculator results section, including the admin dashboard.

### Step 3: Admin Account Takeover

When an admin user accessed the calculator page or any page rendering calculator history:
1. The browser sent a request to the calculator API to retrieve stored expressions
2. The API returned the persisted XSS payload
3. The admin's browser executed the stored JavaScript in context of the admin domain
4. The XSS payload performed CSRF-like actions against the admin interface
5. The attacker gained full admin account access without the admin's knowledge

**Impact:** Complete admin account takeover, enabling:
- Configuration changes (site settings, feature flags)
- User data modification or deletion
- Creation of new admin accounts
- Full system compromise

## Triage Dispute

**Finding:** Validated by technical merits — Stored XSS → Admin ATO chain fully demonstrated with video proof, attack scripts, and 27+ supporting files.

**Triage Issue:** Closure decision impacted by reporter's new-account status on the REDACTED-PLATFORM program. The finding was technically valid but the triage process did not fully account for the reporter's new status on the platform.

**Response:** Reporter prepared extensive public escalation materials, support ticket escalation ([REDACTED-TICKET]), and video evidence (finnal-xss-validation.mp4). Ticket remains open with no response after 5+ days. Precedent cited from Uber, Twitter, and Revive bug bounty escalations.

## Status

Finding validated by technical merit. Support ticket [REDACTED-TICKET] OPEN (5+ days). Public escalation materials prepared. Researcher continuing to escalate through all available channels including public warning platforms.
